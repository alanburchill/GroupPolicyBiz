Just a single new hot fix has come out this week that affects group policy"...

> [981704](<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981704>) The file name of an ADM file is displayed incorrectly in the GPMC report in Windows Vista or in Windows Server 2008

This hotfix resolves a problem with a GPO report in the Group Policy Management Console showing as "Extra Registry Settings" if you have imported a ADM file and then moved it to another location. For more info see <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981704>
