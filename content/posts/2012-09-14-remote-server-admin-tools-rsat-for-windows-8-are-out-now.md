[![RSAT](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSAT_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSAT.png>)If you downloaded and installed Windows Server 2012 last week and your are also running the Windows 8 RTM you may have realised that the Remote Server Administrator Tools for Windows 8 RTM were not released yet. The RSAT tools are of course the all the admin tools you require to manage you Windows Server 2012 features remotely therefore having to reduce the times you need logon to a server to perform any admin task. The most important of tool that comes with RSAT is the Group Policy Management Console ![Winking smile](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png) . Finally Microsoft has now released the tools and you can now download them from here <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28972>

I was also pleased to read in the release notes that you no longer need us the "Turn Windows features on or off" option to have the tools installed as they are all loaded automatically.

> **NOTE:** In this release of Remote Server Administration Tools, all tools are enabled by default. There is no need to open **Turn Windows features on or off** in Windows 8, and enable the tools that you want to use.

This was the behaviour I noticed in the release preview and is nice to see they have continued it in the final version.
