There has been a lot of talk in the news recently around how [Mozilla](<http://www.mozilla.com>) have changed support gears are are now releasing a new browser version every few month. The affect of this is that a lot of enterprise customers ([such as IBM](<http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-attacks-firefox-over-lack-of-corporate-support>)) using Firefox aren't even finished testing before the next version is released. While corporate customers using Firefox 3.6 are still supported, it would seem that this [may not be for long](<http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217923/Mozilla_mulls_Firefox_3.6_retirement_too>) due to the "[cost benefit trade](<http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-attacks-firefox-over-lack-of-corporate-support>)" for Mozilla to play in the Enterprise.

This has of course prompted Microsoft to [starting pushing IE](<http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/06/24/2048217/Microsoft-Exploits-Firefox-4-Uproar-Beats-IE-Drum>) to the corporate customers say "'We've got a great solution for corporate customers with both IE8 and IE9"

So to illustrate this I have graphed the number of days that Microsoft supports Internet Explorer compared to Mozilla's Firefox 4.

**Note:** I assume that IE9 will not have extended support lifecycle as it was NOT released as part of Windows 7.

Certainly having to support IE6 for over 9 years is a major commitment for Microsoft especially when there are so many security issues"... But even while Microsoft encourages users to stop using IE6 <http://www.theie6countdown.com/> they continue to support IE6 as promised for the long haul and are certainly not going to be "[forcing](<http://www.pcworld.com/article/227934/mozilla_plans_to_kill_firefox_35_and_force_upgrades_to_new_browser_version.html>)" anyone to upgrade any time soon. For this reason, plus Internet Explorers excellent out of the box [group policy support](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/tag/internet-explorer/>) (for third party see [Policy Pak](<http://www.policypak.com>)), is why I think IE is hands down best browser for any corporate environment"....
