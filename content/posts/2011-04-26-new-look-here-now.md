In case you have not noticed this web site has now got a new look. The new theme is a lot cleaner (inspired by Metro) and the menus are a little more touch friendly. If you do find any quirks or issues with the site please feel free to send me a message

You also might notice that you get a slightly different look in the title bar (see images below). The gradual fading from left to right is actually a CSS Gradient (using [CSS Gradient Maker](<http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Graphics/CSSGradientBackgroundMaker/Default.html> "CSS Gradient Maker")) so it does not require the download of any image and it will dynamically change to fit the size your screen. Unfortunately this is not supported by IE9 (or earlier) so people who use those browsers will only see a solid colour.

Internet Explorer 9 (or earlier)
