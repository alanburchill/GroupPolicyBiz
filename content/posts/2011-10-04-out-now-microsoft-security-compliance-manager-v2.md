[![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image.png>)Microsoft has made available the final version Microsoft Security Compliance Manager v2 [available for download](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/secguide/archive/2011/10/04/version-2-of-the-microsoft-security-compliance-manager-scm-2-is-now-available-for-download.aspx>). In case you don't already know SCM is a great security analysis tool for your Microsoft products that works great with Group Policy but also with SCCM Desired Configuration Management (DCM) and [Security Content Automation Protocol](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Content_Automation_Protocol>) (SCAP).
