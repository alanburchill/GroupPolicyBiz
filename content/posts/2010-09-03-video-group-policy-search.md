Here is another video from [Lilia Gutnik](<http://www.twitter.com/superlilia>) (Program Manager with the Group Policy Team) on [TechNet Edge](<http://edge.technet.com/>) about the search features in the Group Policy Management Console. If you have every lost a Group Policy Object or just made an edit and was not sure which GPO you were in then this video will show you how to use the advanced search features in GPMC. Very AWESOME!
