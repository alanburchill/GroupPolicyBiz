I just discovered that mine and Jeremy's session will be broadcasted live as a free silverlight streamed session. You can register for the live session at [TechEd Live](<https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032457397&EventCategory=2&IO=g9XUEbjJIKSm5Dxxht2KCA%3d%3d&culture=en-AU&CountryCode=AU> "https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032457397&EventCategory=2&IO=g9XUEbjJIKSm5Dxxht2KCA%3d%3d&culture=en-AU&CountryCode=AU"). So even if you are not in the country please logon to see how awesome [Group Policy Preferences](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2010/03/what-are-group-policy-preferences/>) can be in your organisation.
