[![reader_128](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/reader_128_thumb.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/reader_128.jpg>)If you have used Adobe Reader in your organisation you are probably controlling it some what using group policy preferences as I blogged [here](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2010/06/updated-how-to-make-adobe-reader-more-secure-using-group-policy/>) or via a third party software tools such as [PolicPak](<http://www.policypak.com>). Thankfully Adobe has just [announced](<http://blogs.adobe.com/adobereader/2012/10/announcing-adobe-reader-xi.html>) that the new version of Adobe Reader XI will have Group Policy Template support as well as support for App-V and Citrix XenApp.

> GPO Template for the most common enterprise settings

There is not to much details on what exactly constitutes "common enterprise settings" but at least any setting will be better than nothing. I am certainly looking forward to Adobe Reader becoming one of a select few applications with fully group policy support not to mention one of (if not the only) third party app to fully support admin templates.
