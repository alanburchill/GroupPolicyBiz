[![img0_768x1366](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/img0_768x1366-150x150.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/img0_768x1366.jpg>)Microsoft has just released the Windows 10 version of the Remote Server Admin Tools. This is an addon to Windows 10 that gives you all the remote management MMC tools that are required to manager you Windows servers remotely. It should be noted that it is always good practice to run the latest version of any Remote Management Tools, however as there were no actual under the hood policy changes then you can probably use the Windows 8/8.1 version of these tools without any problems. If all you are after is the new Windows 10 Group Policy Administrative Template settings then all you will need is to download the ADMX/ADML files and install them in your Active Directory Central Store.
