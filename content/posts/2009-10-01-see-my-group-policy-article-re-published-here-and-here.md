My recent Group Policy showing how to apply different power plan's in Windows using Group Policy during different times of the day has picked up some traction and it has now been re-blogged twice. First mention was on the [Green IT Strategy](<http://www.greenitstrategy.com/blog>) (see below) [![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image87.png)](<http://www.greenitstrategy.com/blog/67-power-management/162-alan-burchill-how-to-use-group-policy-preferences-to-manage-windows-power-plans>) See the whole article at <http://www.greenitstrategy.com/blog/67-power-management/162-alan-burchill-how-to-use-group-policy-preferences-to-manage-windows-power-plans> And the second has been on the [Microsoft Group Policy Team](<http://blogs.technet.com/grouppolicy>) which has re-published my article in full"...
