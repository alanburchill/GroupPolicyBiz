[![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/image49.png)](<http://www.runasradio.com/>)On my recent trip to New Zealand to speak a TechEd 2010 I managed to record a podcast with Richard Campbell for the [RunAs Radio](<http://www.runasradio.com/>) podcast.

> The conversation explores how group policy can now be used to map drives, printers and other features, leading to the virtual elimination of login scripts.
