This week setting of the week is called "Change Start Menu power button" which allows you to configured the start menu shutdown button in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. You can find this setting under User Configurations>Policies>Administrative Templates>StartMenu and Taskbar.

If you have setup your computer to support Hybrid-Sleep then you should consider configuring this option to help ensure that your users select the "sleep" option.
