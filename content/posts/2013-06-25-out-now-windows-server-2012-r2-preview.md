If you have a TechNet subscription you are now able to download the ISO images of the Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview. Also available for download is System Center 2012 R2 Preview and SQL Server 2014 CTP1. What is still missing is Windows 8.1 which is expected to be released on 26th June (27th Australian time) sometime around the start of the Build conference.
