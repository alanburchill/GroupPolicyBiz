You can now start to view the session that were presented at the event at <http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012> however I will be posting the Group Policy specific session on this site over the next few days.

This first session is by fellow Group Policy MVP Darren Mar-Elia and has lots of great practical advise for how to design group policy.
