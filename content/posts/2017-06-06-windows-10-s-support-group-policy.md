Recently Microsoft has revealed there will be a new SKU of Windows 10 that will only run signed Apps from the Windows App Store. This new version of the OS will be called Windows 10 S. This version of the OS is specifically designed to only be able to run Universal Windows Platform (a.k.a. UWP) or Centennial packaged apps. This give the OS the advantage of being able to run only application that have been explicitly reviewed and signed by Microsoft to ensure they are of high quality in terms of security, performance and easy of install/uninstall. However, as you can see from the chart below that was provided in the FAQ at [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020089/windows-10-s-faq ](<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020089/windows-10-s-faq>) the Windows 10 S does not support domain joining much like Windows RT did not and therefore you will not be able to deliver Domain Based Group Policy settings to the OS. ![](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Windows10S.png) It is however easy to upgrade a Windows 10 S to the PRO version via the Windows Store so if you do purchase a Windows 10 S device you will be able to upgrade it to support Domain Joining and Group Policy if needed.
