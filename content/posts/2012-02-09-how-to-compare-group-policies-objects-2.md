[![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image.png>)If you have a lot of GPO's in your environment then you know that the process of comparing GPO's can be enormously time-consuming and difficult. Well fellow Group Policy MVP Darren Mar-Elia (a.k.a. [GPOGUY](<https://twitter.com/#!/grouppolicyguy>)) and CTO & Founder of [SDM Software](<http://www.sdmsoftware.com/>) has just released a new version of the [GPO Compare tool](<http://www.sdmsoftware.com/products/group-policy-compare/>). This is a super cool tool allows you to quickly compare up to 4 Group Policy Object. The thing I really like about this tool is that it allow you to compare multiple LIVE GPO's!!! Which is great for tracking changes of live GPO's against a baseline settings.

For a tour of the product then take a look at the video below:

**Disclosure:** I was not asked to do this review however as a Group Policy MVP I have received a NFR copy of the software.
