[![IE9answer](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IE9answer_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IE9answer.png>)The Internet Explorer Administration Kit for IE9 has just been released to the public. One of the cool things that this tool can do is make a silent MSI for installing IE9 which is very handy if you are going to deploy it via Group Policy.
