[![hotfix_icon](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hotfix_icon_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hotfix_icon.png>)Microsoft have recently released a couple of hotfixes relating to Group Policy. As you are probably aware there are a number of [Group Policy related hotfixes](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2011/02/group-policy-hotfixs-in-windows-7-and-windows-server-2008-service-pack-1/>) in Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 which is [about to be released](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2011/02/group-policy-hotfixs-in-windows-7-and-windows-server-2008-service-pack-1/>) (on Feb 22nd 2011) however these two particular patches are listed as being required even for Service Pack 1.

I do note that KB981704**** has been out for a while and seems to have been just updated to reflect that it is still required for Service Pack 1.

[KB981704](<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981704/en-us?sd=rss&spid=14019>) \- The file name of an ADM file is displayed incorrectly in the GPMC report in Windows Vista, in Windows Server 2008, in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2.

[KB2460922](<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2460922/en-us?sd=rss&spid=14019>) \- Group Policy preference item-level targeting does not work for 64-bit versions of Windows 7
