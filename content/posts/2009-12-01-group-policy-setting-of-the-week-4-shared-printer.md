This week I have selected the "Shared Printer" Group Policy Preference as my Group Policy Setting of the Week (GPSW). This is arguably one of the most wanted group policy settings by Group Policy admin's that was missing before group policy preferences. It was possible previous to preferences to map printers natively in group policy using the [pushprinterconnections.exe](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722179\(WS.10\).aspx>) option but like the Star Trek Deep Space Nine episode "[Trials and Tribble-ations](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_and_Tribble-ations> "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_and_Tribble-ations")" we defiantly "do not discuss it with outsiders" as this is just a setting we would rather forget. The "Shared Printer" options can be found under by right clicking on "User Configuration > Preferences > Control Panel Settings > Printers". As with most group policy preference settings you also have the option to CRUD (see [Group Policy Preferences Colorful and Mysteriously Powerful Just Like Windows 7](<http://blogs.technet.com/grouppolicy/archive/2009/11/02/group-policy-preferences-colorful-and-mysteriously-powerful-just-like-windows-7.aspx> "http://blogs.technet.com/grouppolicy/archive/2009/11/02/group-policy-preferences-colorful-and-mysteriously-powerful-just-like-windows-7.aspx")) which means you can also use this option to remove any printer mapping that people have to printer queues that no longer exist.

More commonly you can map a printer via a single security group or IP range but you can really start to do some really advance targeting when you start to combine multiple targeting setting using Boolean logic. If you want to see some more advanced targeting options for printer mappings then check out my "[How to use Group Policy Preference to dynamically map printers when using Roaming Profiles](<http://abskb.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!8834054641A09100!915.entry>)" article.

Just use the default printer option wisely however as you could end up annoying your manager who likes to printer to their locally attached printer. Enjoy!
