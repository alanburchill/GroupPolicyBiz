[![BUILD_Logo](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BUILD_Logo_thumb.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BUILD_Logo.jpg>)As I mentioned in my previous post Windows 8 is having it big reveal at the BUILD conference right now. However some of the session are not developer related and there has been some really cool information revealed about Windows Server 8 and Hyper-V (I knew I should have gone).

For your convenience I have listed all the Windows Server/Hyper-V sessions below:
