Lilia Gutnik from the Group Policy Team at Microsoft (a.k.a. [@superlilia](<http://www.twitter.com/superlilia>) ) recently recorded some video's with [Adam Bomb](<http://edge.technet.com/People/AdamBomb/>) from [TechNet Edge](<http://edge.technet.com/>). This video shows a cool new Group Policy troubleshooting tool called GPLogview which is a very useful to decipher those very long and complicated group policy event log's that Windows give you out of the box.
