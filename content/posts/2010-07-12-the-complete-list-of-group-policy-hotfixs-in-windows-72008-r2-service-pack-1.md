[![windows-7-logo](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/windows7logo_thumb.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/windows7logo.jpg>)The beta of [Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 beta](<http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/sp1.aspx>) has [now been released to the public](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ff183870.aspx>) for testing. For your benefit I have parsed through the [complete list of hotfixes](<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=61924cea-83fe-46e9-96d8-027ae59ddc11>) and I have listed out all the group policy specific setting. If you just want the service pack right now you can download it here <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ff183870.aspx> I have highlighted the two hotfixes that stand out it my mind as the issues that have been most annoying bugs with group policy with Windows 7 RTM. I have also posted an installation screenshot walk though on my other blog here <http://www.smartergeek.info/2010/07/install-screenshots-windows-7-service-pack-1-beta/> Hotfix Description | Link to support article
