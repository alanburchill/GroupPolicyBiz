First off"... Merry Christmas (or seasons greeting)"... Secondly sorry I have been slack with updating my web site lately but I have been really busy at work and since Christmas Day (which is also my birthday) I have been playing lots of FarCry 3 and Star Wars The Old Republic so".... sorry"...

But, If you are still locking for you fill of Group Policy info over the end of year break I did notice there has been a new video published on TechNet Edge showing casing what is new with Group Policy in Windows 2012.

Thanks to [Rick Claws](<https://twitter.com/RicksterCDN>) and Zachary Alexander for mentioning my web site and Group Policy Apps of course you are already at my wed site"...

But if you want the apps that were mentioned you can get them at:

  * Windows 8 App <http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/ce0a5b61-1e67-4c88-a396-7f86a38e8c87>
  * Windows Phone 7/8 <http://www.windowsphone.com/en-au/store/app/group-policy/5c39e194-1280-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8>
