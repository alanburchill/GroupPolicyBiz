This is a video of my [Group Policy Preferences](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2010/03/what-are-group-policy-preferences/>) session I presented in TechEd New Zealand"... I had a really good time during this session and the feedback I got from the session was really positive. In this session I introduced Group Policy Preferences and showed a number of demo's as to how it can be used in your environment to eliminate logon scripts.
