I honestly have no idea, probably not, still it is interesting that the "Supported on:" section of any Windows 8 group policy settings does list "Windows RT". Hopefully more information will come out about enterprise support for Windows RT after the BIG SECRET Microsoft Tablet launch event that is going to be held this Monday (USA time).
