[![OfcLogoTextSmall](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/OfcLogoTextSmall_thumb.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/OfcLogoTextSmall.jpg>)In case you missed it the Office 2016 ADMX templates are no longer part of the Office Resource Kit like previous version.

You can download the ADMX files here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030>

Also, if you have a bunch of Office 2013 GPO setting you want to copy across to Office 2016 policy you can also there is a PowerShell script on GitHub that will convert any of the configured settings from 2013 to 2016. Very handy if you don't like having to re-creation all you Office GPO setting by hand.
