One of the great new features with Windows 7 was Bitlocker to Go that enabled IT Administrators to ensure that all data written to USB drives is encrypted. In conjunction with this new feature Microsoft also added another option called "Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker" which allowed user to still read the files off USB drives that were not encrypted. The problem with this policy setting is that it is only supported on Windows 7 family computers so unless you are running a SOE that is 100% Windows 7 users could simply logon to XP or Windows Vista to get around this restriction.

Then click on Action > New > Registry Item type **System\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies** into the Key Path field then type **WriteProtect** into the Value Name field and **1** in the Value Data field and click **OK**.
