> Enable enterprise customers to customize the default lock screen.

You may have thought that this image was customisable by the users in the control panel already however this would only configure the image of the lock screen after the user had logged on to the computer. Meaning you were always presented with the Seattle Space Needle cartoon image every time you logged off or rebooted your computer. This image is nice to look at but this is definitely something the would be changed in most corporate environment to display their own corporate logo or a perhaps some disclaimer text. The new setting is called "Force a specific default lock screen image" it can be found under Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Control Panel > Personalization. **Note** : It will only appear after you November 2012 update is installed on the computer you are editing the group policy object from but you must ALSO apply it to the workstation/server that the setting is being applied.

Below is an example that I have configured to use the default wallpaper as also the default lock screen image.
