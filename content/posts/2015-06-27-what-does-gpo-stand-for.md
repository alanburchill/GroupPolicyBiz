A GPO when referring to Microsoft Technologies is short for a Group Policy Object. A Group Policy Object is a Policy object that is saved into Active Directory that can be applied to Users of Computers. The object itself has a list of settings that can be configured by an IT Administrator and then periodically (normally every 90 minutes) gets re-applied to the computer.
