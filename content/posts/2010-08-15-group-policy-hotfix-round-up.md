In the [July 29 to August 12th Hot-fix release for Windows 6/7](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/hot/archive/2010/08/13/jul-29-aug-12-hot-fix-kb-articles-weekly-release-windows-6-7.aspx>) there have been a number of Group Policy related hotfixes released. As far as I can tell none of these hotfixes are listed as being in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 that is currently in beta (see [The complete list of Group Policy Hotfix's in Windows 7/2008 R2 Service Pack 1](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2010/07/the-complete-list-of-group-policy-hotfixs-in-windows-72008-r2-service-pack-1/>)) so if you are experiencing any of the above hotfixes it will be some time before you will be able to deploy them as part of a service pack.
