In this screencast I show you how to use the Group Policy Preferences [Shortcuts Extension](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730592.aspx> "Shortcuts Extension") to deploy shortcuts to a users desktop. This video also demonstrates how you can configure the shortcut to only apply once for the users and how you can configure them to automatically be cleaned up when no longer required.
