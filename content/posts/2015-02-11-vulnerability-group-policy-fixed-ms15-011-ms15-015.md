[![COG1_thumb.png](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/COG1_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/COG1_thumb.png>)Today Microsoft published hotfix MS15-011 and MS15-014 that addressed a potential issues that could allow an man in the middle attack on computer. This vulnerability affected system that could be compromised by a man in the middle or what I like to call a "Coffee Shop Attack". The summary is that by interfering with the traffic that is being sent to a client a malicious person can force a client to fall back to default weaker security settings. Once this is done it would then be possible to trick a client into running a malicious logon script. Therefore Microsoft has released two hotfixes to fix this vulnerability:

  * MS015-011 - Microsoft has change the fall back behaviour of security setting if it encounters a corrupt Client Side Extension file.
  * MS015-014 - Microsoft has enable mutual authentication for Group Policy UNC paths meaning that a client cannot be tricked into access the same path using a different protocol such as WebDAV.

Needless to say that this is an important update to Windows and one that particularly changes the behaviour of Group Policy to mitigate the threat.
