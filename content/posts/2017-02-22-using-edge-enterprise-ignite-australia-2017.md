This is a video of the Using Edge in the Enterprise session I did at Ignite Australia 2017. This session covers the recent improvements in Edge in Windows 10 and how the new Group Policy features can enabled it to be used in the Enterprise. I also cover some of the new features such as Favourite Synchronisation and Windows Defender Application Guard that will be coming out soon to sandbox the Edge process for improved security.
