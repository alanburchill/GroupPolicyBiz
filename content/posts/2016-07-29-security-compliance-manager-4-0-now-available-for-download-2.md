The Security Compliance Manager (SCM) is a free tool from Microsoft that enables you to quickly configure, and manage the computers in your environment using Group Policy and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. This version of SCM supports Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016.

You can easily configure computers running Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 based on [Microsoft Recommended Security Baselines](<http://ift.tt/2adAVfZ>) and industry best practices.

You can download SCM 4.0 [here](<http://ift.tt/2aARDJG>).

Updates include:

  * Support for existing Windows 10 version 1507, and Windows 10 version 1511 security baselines
  * Support for upcoming Windows 10 version 1607, and Windows Server 2016
  * Bug fixes for 'Compare' and 'Simple View' features in SCM


The latest version of SCM offers all the same great features as before, plus bug fixes, and added support for upcoming baselines. SCM 4.0 provides a single location for creating, managing, analyzing, and customizing baselines to secure your environment quicker and more efficiently. In addition to the latest software releases, you can also configure previous additions of Windows client, Server, and Microsoft Office.

SCM provides DCM 2007 configuration packs that allow you to manage configuration drifts using Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. Microsoft's [Operations Management Suite](<http://ift.tt/29KYFt7>) also supports monitoring for Security Baselines in your Server environments.
