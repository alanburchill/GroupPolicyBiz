Notably that said that one of the changes in the operating system include an "options to boot into alternate screens", hopefully this means that there will be a Group Policy option to configure a boot to desktop option that I [have ranted ~~talked~~ about before](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2012/03/the-must-have-windows-8-start-menu-group-policy-setting/>) and also [hacked a workaround](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2013/05/how-to-enable-boot-to-desktop-group-policy-for-windows-8/>).

Unfortunately there was no details in the blog post about any group policy enhancement however they did say that "Windows 8.1 will also include big bets for business in areas such as management ".... we'll have more to say "... next week at TechEd North America.".
