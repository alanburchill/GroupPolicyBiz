The Group Policy team hasn't been sitting idly by, they've added a bunch of new features to Group Policy and Group Policy Preferences, and [Adam Bomb](<http://technet.microsoft.com/edge/adam_bomb.aspx>) sat down with Michael and Lilia to go over some of them. They cover PowerShell integration, new functionality in Directory Services, Auditing, new policies to cover new features like Direct Access, and UI enhancements like the ability to filter policy. They are very keen to hear from you on what else they should cover, so please let us know for future videos!You can keep up with the adventures of Michael and Lilia at the [Group Policy Blog](<http://blogs.technet.com/grouppolicy/>)
