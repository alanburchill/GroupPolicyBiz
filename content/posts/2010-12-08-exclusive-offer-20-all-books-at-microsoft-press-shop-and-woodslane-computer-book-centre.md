I am SUPER excited to be able to offer a 20% discount off all books at both the [Microsoft Press Shop Australia](<http://mspress.com.au>) and at [Woodslane Computer Book Centre](<http://www.computer.bookcentre.com.au/>) online book stores.

To take advantage of this offer simply use the code **GROUPPOLICYBIZ** to get 20% off the total cost of you basket when you checkout. (Until 30 June 2011)

What I really like about both these sites is they have a [Guaranteed Express Delivery](<http://www.mspress.com.au/deliverypolicy.aspx>), which means you get your books faster from these sites than buying them from Amazon if you are in Australia or New Zealand.

(Note: You need to be located in Australian or New Zealand to take advantage of this offer)
