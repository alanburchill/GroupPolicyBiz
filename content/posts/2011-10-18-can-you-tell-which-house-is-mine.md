There is a company call [Near Map](<http://www.nearmap.com/>) that takes frequent high detail areal images of my suburb. There also happen to have a twitter account ( [@nearmap](<http://www.twitter.com/nearmap>) ) that announces when they are about to take a photos of certain regions. SO".... last time they took a photo of my area I raced out to the front yard to make a few letters.

As I only have limited time and material to make out some letters I decided that I would spell out the initial of my favourite tech topic"... Group Policy.

**Hint:** Look for the letters "GP"

That's my house"... Can you tell I like "GP".
