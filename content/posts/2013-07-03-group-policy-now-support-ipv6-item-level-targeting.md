While Windows has supported IPv6 natively for many years now Microsoft has been slowly chipping away at IPv6 support for many of its other products. Well the good news is that Group Policy Preferences in Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 now allows you to target Group Policy Preferences using IPv6 addresses.

To enable this new feature all you need to do it check "Use IPv6" in the IP Address Range Item Level Targeting feature.

As soon as you do this the IP Address range is then change to the IPv6 format allowing you to now target Group Policy Preferences to IPv6 address ranges.

And in case you have a mixed IPv4 / IPv6 rollout you can mix the types within the same targeting rule"...
