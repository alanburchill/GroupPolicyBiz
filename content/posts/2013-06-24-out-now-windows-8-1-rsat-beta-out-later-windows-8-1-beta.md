Microsoft has put the carriage in front of the horse and released the Windows 8.1 Remote Server Admin Tools before they release Windows 8.1 Beta. In case you are wondering what this has to do with Group Policy, RSAT is how you get the Group Policy Management Console installed on Client operating systems as by default it is not part of the client Operating System. As strange as this might sound its actually a great move as previously the Remote Server Admin Tools were released after the Operating System was released.

In any case this is going to be the first of many beta products that Microsoft will release this week so expect a lot more information coming on Windows 8.1 really soon"...
