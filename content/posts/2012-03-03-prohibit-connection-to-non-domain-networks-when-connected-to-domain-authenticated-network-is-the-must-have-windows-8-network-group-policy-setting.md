[![win8_logo_0](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/win8_logo_0_thumb1.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/win8_logo_01.jpg>) So this is definitely a policy setting that give IT admins something they have been asking for a long time. I also mentioned this feature in my [What's new in Windows 8 Part #2](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2011/10/whats-new-in-windows-8-part-2/>) post however in all my test I CANNOT get this setting to work. As far as I know the policy setting called "Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network" prevents users from connecting a second internet connection to a computer if it is already connected to a Domain Network connection. Very handy if the setting worked"...

I assume for now the setting is just broken (or i am just to dumb to make it work), If i get this setting to actually work in my tests I will update this post, but as this is a setting is going to be really popular I thought I would just give you a heads up that this setting is there even if it is broken"...

As you can see when this policy setting the Public Network connected that is connected to the Internet clearly says "Internet access"...

If you do get the setting to work please tell me how you did it"...
