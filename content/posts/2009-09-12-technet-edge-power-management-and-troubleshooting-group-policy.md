[Adam Bomb](<http://technet.microsoft.com/edge/adam_bomb.aspx>) sat down with Michael Kleef and Mark Gray in the Group Policy team to talk about the kind of settings in Windows 7 that can be controlled by policy. Mark also gives us a primer on how to troubleshoot group policy issues by turning on GP logging on the client.
