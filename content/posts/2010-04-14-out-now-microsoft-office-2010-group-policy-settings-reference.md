[![ee663032_feature_Office_main](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ee663032_feature_Office_main_thumb.jpg)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ee663032_feature_Office_main.jpg>) Microsoft have just released the reference spreadsheet that outline all the new and removed Group Policy settings. The spreadsheet also has a Non-Versioned section that shows all the is setting that write directly to the registry (a.k.a. Non-Managed). This is a really good sign that Microsoft Office 2010 is very close to RTM.
