As I mentioned in my previous blog post there is a new Group Policy setting called "Redirect folders on primary computers only". As the descriptions says this "policy setting is useful to improve logon performance and to increase security for user data on computers where the user might not want to download private data, such as on a meeting room computer or on a computer in a remote office.". Problem is there is no UI in Active Directory Users and Computers to configure a primary computer on a users account. So below I show you how you can configure a primary computer on a users account to allow this setting to work. **Update:** Microsoft has now released a blog post about this feature as well at [Configuring Primary Computers for Folder Redirection and Roaming Profiles in Windows Server "8" Beta](</b/filecab/archive/2012/03/30/configuring-primary-computers-for-folder-redirection-and-roaming-profiles-in-windows-server-8-beta.aspx>) **Prerequisite:** The Domain must have the Windows Sever 8 Schema applied to you domain for this to work. **Step 1.** Launch Active Directory Administrative Console and open the properties of the computer your want to make a "Primary Computer".
