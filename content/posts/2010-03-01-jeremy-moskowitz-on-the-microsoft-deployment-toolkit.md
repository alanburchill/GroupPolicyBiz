Recently, the SPECOPS Software roadshow **_"Changes, Challenges and Choices When rolling out Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7"_** made its way to the Microsoft Alpharetta office in the US. The featured speaker was Jeremy Moskowitz of GPanswers.com. During the break [John Baker](<http://technet.microsoft.com/edge/ff832960.aspx?category=John%20Baker>) had the opportunity to sit down with Jeremy and get a quick interview.
