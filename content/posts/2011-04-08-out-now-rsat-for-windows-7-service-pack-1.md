If you edit Group Policy on you local computer you will be glad to hear that Microsoft has just released the Remove Server Admin Tools update for Windows 7 Service Pack 1 which has an updated version of GPMC. This resolves the "[The update does not apply to your system](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/joscon/archive/2011/02/11/installing-the-rsat-tools-on-windows-7-sp1-installations.aspx>)" error message if you had re-installed Windows 7 and loaded Service Pack 1 and then you tried to install RSAT.
