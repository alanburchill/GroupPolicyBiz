[![AGPM_Logo](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AGPM_Logo_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AGPM_Logo.png>)A video by fellow MVP [Kurt Roggen](<http://trycatch.be/blogs/roggenk/>) has just been released on [TechNet Edge](<http://edge.technet.com/>) about the Advanced Group Policy Management tool. I have posted a few article about AGPM before (starting [here](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2010/06/introduction-to-advanced-group-policy-management-a-k-a-agpm-v4/>)) but this video is a great primer for the product talking about what it does, how to install it and how to use the product.
