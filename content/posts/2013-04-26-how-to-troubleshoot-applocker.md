However there are a number of steps and pre-requisites for this feature to work that seem to catch people up quite often. So below is a simple troubleshooting flow chart that should help you go through the common issues that happen when setting up an AppLocker rule in your environment.

**Rule Tip:** It's also worth mentioning to NEVER just configure a single Deny rule without the "Default Rules" also configured as this will have the affect of blocking ALL programs and thus breaking your computer.
