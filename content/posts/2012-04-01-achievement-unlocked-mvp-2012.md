[![MVP_Horizontal_BlueOnly](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MVP_Horizontal_BlueOnly_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MVP_Horizontal_BlueOnly.png>)Just letting you all know that today I got an email confirming that my MVP status is being renewed for 2012. It is a real honour to get this award in what will be a really exciting time with all the new exciting new information to be share this year with the release of a new version of Windows.

Sidenote: Being an April MVP means that we get the email sent to us on or around April 1st which can be very cruel"...
