### Editing existing uncontrolled GPO's in AGPM

If you are deploying AGPM into an existing environment (and you probably are) then you will probably want to editing you existing GPO's. Any GPO that is not managed by AGPM is called an "Uncontrolled" GPO and as such will not be touched until it is specifically made into a "Controlled" policy. **Step 1.** Logon as Alan to a computer that has GPMC and the AGPM client **Step 2.** Open GPMC and click on **Change Control** and then then **Uncontrolled** tab then right click on the GPO you want to "Control" and then click on **Control"...** **** [![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image_thumb155.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image160.png>)  **Step 3.** Add a comment to the GPO as its initial comment then click **OK** **** [![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image_thumb156.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image161.png>) This Group Policy is now "controlled"  [![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image_thumb162.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image167.png>) Hopefully this has series given you enough of an introduction to AGPM to get it installed and start to perform basic changes and approvals to GPO setting "...
