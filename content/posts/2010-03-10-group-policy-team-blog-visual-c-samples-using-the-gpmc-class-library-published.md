Tom Archer just wrote a blog post about four new sample C# programs that interface with the Group Policy Management Console to perform general group policy tasks in Active Directory. These are some very usefull sample if you are looking at writing your onw applications for automaitcing Group Policy object tasks.

Sample's are:

  * How to Back Up All GPOs in a Domain
  * How to Restore a Domain's GPOs
  * How to Import GPOs from a Backup
  * How to List Unlinked GPOs in a Domain
