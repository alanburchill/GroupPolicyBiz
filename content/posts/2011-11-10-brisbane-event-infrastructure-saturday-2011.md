This event is a full day users group meeting jammed pack full of 18 session of content. Thanks to our sponsors this is a fully catered event (including Coffee!!!) and we will have HEAPS or prizes to win. The event will be held at the Microsoft Brisbane office on Saturday December 3rd.

The session detail and schedule are now published so if you would like to know more about the event or register go <http://www.infrastructuresaturday.com>

And of course I will also be speaking at this even about what is new with Group Policy in Windows 8.
