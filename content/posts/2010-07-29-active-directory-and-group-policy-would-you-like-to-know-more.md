[Ned Pyle](<http://blogs.technet.com/members/NedPyle/>) from the Active Directory Service team has just done a super post to the [Ask the Directory Services Team](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/>) called [Post-Graduate AD Studies](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2010/07/27/post-graduate-ad-studies.aspx>). This is a collection of links to pretty much every AD/Group Policy related TechNet article known to man. Definitely a post that you will want to bookmark to use as a reference whenever you have any AD or Group Policy related problems or questions.

Below is a list of all the Group Policy related articles that are listed in the post:

  * [Group Policy](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc758751\(WS.10\).aspx>)
  * [AppLocker](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd723678\(WS.10\).aspx>)
