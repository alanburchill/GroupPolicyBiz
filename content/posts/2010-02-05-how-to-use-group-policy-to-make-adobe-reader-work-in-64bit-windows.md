[Leo Davidson](<http://www.pretentiousname.com/>) recently [posted](<http://www.pretentiousname.com/adobe_pdf_x64_fix/>) a fix for Adobe Reader integration on 64bit Windows. His fix resolves the thumbnail and file preview feature when you install Adobe Reader (which is still only available in 32bit) in 64bit Windows which Adobe have not seemed to work out for over 3 years now. On his site he has tool that you can [download](<http://www.pretentiousname.com/adobe_pdf_x64_fix/index.html#downl>) to manually apply the PDF fix. The file preview is just a simple registry key change so I have added some more instruction showing how to makes these changes using Group Policy Preferences. **Update:** Thanks to the feedback from Leo Davidson I have updated the instructions to only "Update" the value if it already exists. **Update2** : Reduced the complexity to check for a 64bit OS.

### Method 2: File Preview Fix "“ Import Settings "“ Easy

Step 1. Download this preconfigured XML Group Policy configuration that I have already made for you ([HERE](<https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=8834054641a09100&resid=8834054641A09100!3174&authkey=CHDHEHSxQiI%24>)) Step 2. Open Group Policy Management Console Step 3. Edit a machine based Group Policy Object (GPO) Step 4. Go to Computer Configuration > Preferences > Windows Settings > Registry and copy the file you downloaded in step 1. into and paste it into the blank area [![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image_thumb23.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image23.png>) Step 5. Click Yes to confirm the import and you are done.

### Thumbnail Preview

The second fix that Leo's tool does it fix the thumbnail live preview option by implementing a custom written thumbnail bridge. Still working on a group policy preference to fix this so I will post again when I get this working. A big thanks to Leo Davidson so be sure to visit his web [site](<http://www.pretentiousname.com/adobe_pdf_x64_fix/>) and make a donation if you find this fix useful"...
