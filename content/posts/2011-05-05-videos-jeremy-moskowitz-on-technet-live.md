TechNet Live (Netherlands) have just released some videos of a presentation done by fellow Group Policy MVP [Jeremy Moskowitz](<http://www.twitter.com/jeremymoskowitz>). Both these videos are a great watch and Jeremy's style is as always very entertaining"...

The first video "[Troubleshooting Group Policy](<http://technet.microsoft.com/nl-nl/edge/video/troubleshooting-group-policy>)" is the much better version of the session I presented at the last minute at TechEd NZ 2010 (see here [Troubleshooting Group Policy](<http://www.msteched.com/2010/NewZealand/CLI309> "Troubleshooting Group Policy")) due to Jeremy being quarantined with suspected swine flu.

The other session "[Total workstation lockdown: You action plan](<http://technet.microsoft.com/nl-nl/edge/total-workstation-lockdown-your-action-plan.aspx>)" shows how you can use Group Policy to configure a lockdown computer configuration.
