I was recently approached to do a book review on "[Least Privilege Security for Windows 7,Vista and XP by Russell Smith](<http://www.packtpub.com/least-privilege-security-for-windows-7-vista-and-xp/book?utm_source=grouppolicy.biz&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_003868>)" published by [Packt Publishing](<http://www.packtpub.com/>). This book is a comprehensive guide at showing how to configure your Windows environment so that your users can operate without administrator permissions. While most administrators realise that giving administrators access to the end users is really poor practice and can lead to many security issues it is quite often a permission that some users require to do their job for whatever reason.

Its good to see that this book is quite comprehensive in the number of areas of technology as I firmly believe that you really need to take a multi-prong approach when it comes to security. Here is a list of the just some of technologies that this book talks about to achieve a Least Privilege Security:

  * Program Compatibility Wizard [![image](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/image71.png)](<http://www.packtpub.com/least-privilege-security-for-windows-7-vista-and-xp/book?utm_source=grouppolicy.biz&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_003868>)
  * Applications Compatibility Wizard
  * User Account Control
  * Group Policy Software Deployment
  * Internet Explorer Add-on Management
  * Troubleshooting Remote Users
  * Configuring Windows Firewall
  * Software Restrictions Policies and AppLocker
  * Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
  * CD Burning
  * ActiveX Controls
  * Changing system time and time zones
  * Power Management
  * Managing networks
  * Standard Users Analyzer
  * Applications Compatibility Toolkit
  * Logon Scripts
  * Remote Desktop Services
  * App-V
  * Med-V


In quite a lot of chapters Russell goes into detail step by step instructions explain how to use the above technologies. But what I really like is that he also takes the time to talk about how to approach the Cultural and Political challenges in implementing this security model as this is normally the hardest part achieving a secure environment.

Configuring security is something that organisation rarely spend much time thinking about and even more rarely do anything about. Having this book in your library will at least give you the knowledge that is required to start to configure your Windows system to be more secure. I would definitely recommend this book as a reference to anyone in an organisation who is responsible for designing and/or making changes to their Windows environment.
