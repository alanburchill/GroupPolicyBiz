Aamer Shedam from Microsoft's [Ask the Performance Team](<http://blogs.technet.com/askperf>) has just blogged about how Windows 7 will only show one printer in "Devices and Printers" if you have that same two printers installed on the one computer (see below).

Edit a Group Policy Object that is applied to all the workstation you want this Browser Ballot disabled. Step 2. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Preferences > Windows Settings > Registry and create a "New Registry Item" Step 3. Type "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\\{2227a280-3aea-1069-a2de-08002b30309d}" in the Key Path tick "Default", then select REG_DWORD as the value type "Printers" in the value data and then click "OK".
