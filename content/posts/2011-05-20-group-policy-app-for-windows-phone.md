[![Logo173x173](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Logo173x173_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Logo173x173.png>)I am very pleased to announce that my Group Policy App for Windows Phone is now on the Windows Phone Marketplace. This app pulls in all the RSS feeds from this site and many other Group Policy related web sites. It is also uses twitter to show you all the tweets with the [#grouppolicy](<https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23grouppolicy>) tag and the all the tweets from the official Group Policy Team twitter account [@gpteam](<http://twitter.com/gpteam>).

Best of all this app is FREE!!!

In case you were wondering who those guys are in the background of the app check out the [Meet the Group Policy People](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2011/03/meet-the-group-policy-people/>) article.

Now I have to admit that I am not a developer but this is my first attempt at making a Windows Phone application and it has been pretty easy. But if there are any issues with the application please use the Feedback button (under About) to email me directly or if you have any feature suggestions. I also have to give a lot of credit has to go to [David Glover](<http://twitter.com/dglover>) who wrote the Social Viewer application template which this app is based on that can be found at <http://socialviewer.codeplex.com> .

**Note:** There is an update coming some time next week that will enable Facebook support and enable add support (got to pay the bills).
