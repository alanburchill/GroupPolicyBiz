Matt Call from Microsoft has just blog the different with describes the impact of no longer being able to customise the Windows Start menu using the Default Users Profile. In case you did not know you could previously set a users start menu by baking the layout into the Windows OS image default users profile by using a CopyProfile process. This has now been removed and his article goes into how to deal with the way to order the process to avoid issues. So check out his post at [https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mattcall/2018/05/11/copyprofile-and-the-start-menu-wheres-my-start-menu/ ](<https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mattcall/2018/05/11/copyprofile-and-the-start-menu-wheres-my-start-menu/>) .
