[![hotfix_icon](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hotfix_icon_thumb1.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hotfix_icon1.png>)I [mentioned](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/2011/02/new-group-policy-hotfixs-2/>) last week a few new Group Policy related Knowledge base articles that were just released / updated. Well [Scott Goad](<http://blogs.technet.com/sgoad/ProfileUrlRedirect.ashx>) from one of my favourite blogs ([Ask the Directory Service Team](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds>)) just published a round up of all the [Active Directory KB articles from 6th Feb to 19th Feb](<http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2011/02/21/new-kb-articles-2-6-2-19.aspx>) . So for your convenience I have extracted the relevant GP related KB articles and listed them below.
