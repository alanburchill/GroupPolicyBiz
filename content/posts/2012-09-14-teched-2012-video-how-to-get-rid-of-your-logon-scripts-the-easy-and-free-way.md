The second recording of my three session I presented at TechEd NZ 2012 has now been published on the [Channel 9](<http://channel9.msdn.com/>) web site (Microsoft, not Australia TV). Essentially this is my Group Policy Preferences session and is one I have done many times before. Certainly this was my highest rated session at about position #30 out of 180 session for the entire event. So"... if you are still running logon scripts in your organisation then you should definitely check out the video below"...
