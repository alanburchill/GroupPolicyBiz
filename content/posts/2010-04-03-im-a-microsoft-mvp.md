Yesterday I was absolutely thrilled to find out that I was awarded a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional. This is truly a fantastic honour to be recognised for all my contributions to the Group Policy community both on this online and at speaking engagements. This is certainly my most treasured professional achievement that I have ever received and has certainly given me more motivation to keep blogging about all things Group Policy related.
