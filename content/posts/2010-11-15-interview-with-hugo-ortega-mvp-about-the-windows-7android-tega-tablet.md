When I recently spoke at [Infrastructure Saturday](<http://infrastructuresaturday.org/>) I was there I was able to interview [Hugo Ortega](<http://twitter.com/mrmobilepc>) the all round table guru (and Tablet MVP) from [Tegatech Australia](<http://www.tegatech.com.au>) about the the stunning cool Windows 7 tablets that the company he works for makes. What I really liked about this was that this device was a really good example of what you can do with Windows 7 on a slate hardware device with a capacitive.

Now what does this have to do with Group Policy? Well these devices run fully blown Windows 7 meaning you can connect them to the domain and configure them via Group Policy (nice).

If you still think that Windows 7 is not a good for a table device these device also ship in a dual boot Windows 7 / Android configuration.

**Disclaimer:** This interview was NOT paid for or solicited in any way by TegaTech. I only did this interview because I like to support fellow MVP's and I thought the device was really COOL!
