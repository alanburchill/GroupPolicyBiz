[![IE9answer](https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IE9answer_thumb.png)](<https://www.grouppolicy.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IE9answer.png>)Microsoft today released the Internet Explorer 9 Release Candidate to the public for testing at <http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/> . This new browser is the cleanest, fastest, most secure, standards compliant browser that Microsoft (and anyone else) has ever released. If you have using IE9 in your organisation (and you probably are) they you need to take a serious look a upgrading to this browser when it is released.

With a new browser comes new features, with new features comes new options and with new options come NEW GROUP POLICIES!!!

So below is a summary list of all the new group policy setting for IE9 take from <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/library/ff973977.aspx>

**Updated:** I have now added a screenshot of each of the policy setting. A couple of them I can't seem to find yet but i will keep looking"...
