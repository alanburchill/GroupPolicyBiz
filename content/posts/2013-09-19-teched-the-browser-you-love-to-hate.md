If you have ever seen Chris Jacksons (a.k.a. [App Compat Guy](<http://www.twitter.com/appcompatguy>)) sessions you will know that he is an amazing speaker with a very distinctive (and geeky) presentation style. So when I had the opportunity to present with him at TechEd New Zealand 2013 I was super excited to be able present some of the great new features in Internet Explorer 11. In this session we present two side of the why and how to you should upgrade to the latest version of Internet Explorer in your organisation. Chris presents a lot of very good reasons why you should upgrade off from IE8 and I show you how you can use Group Policy to configured and control the browser for the users.

So sit back and check out video below of our session:
